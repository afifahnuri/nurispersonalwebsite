<h1>My Education Background</h1>
<br>
<h2>My Primary School</h2>
<img src="png/skkd.png" border="2" width="50% lenght="50%" hspace="26%">
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">This is my Primary School which is Sekolah Kebangsaan Kampung Dew. I have studied in this school for 6 years from 7 years old until 12 years old. The teachers in this school are kind and nice to me. I also have many good friends here. One of my best friends is Ainur Afiqah who is always be with me at any time. When I am in Primary School I was a library prefect and also an active student. I am an introvert but I always join any competition that are availablle at that time. One of my achivements during in my Primary School is to be the 1st place in English Public Speaking Competition. Then, I have been chosen to compete in the district level and even it was a bit though I managed to get 3rd place in the English Public Speaking Competition. Yes, my favourite subject at school is English Language.</p>
<p align="justify">My favourite teacher in this school is Teacher Halipah which is my English teacher. She is a kind and beautiful woman with fair skin. She also wears glass. Teacher Halipah is a teacher that I really love when I am in my primary school. I love her because she always give me her support in whatever I do. When I am in my primary school, I also love to play netball and also take part in the netball competition. I have an experience where my finger injured because I want to catch the ball. During in my primary school I also love to take part in drawing competition. I also remembered that I manage to get the 2nd place in decorating Eid Mubarak card. At the old time, I was a creative girl but now my creativity has become faded. I hope that I can be creative as before. So, that is all about what I want to share about my primary school. The memories become more vivid with the pace of time. I still remember those days...</p>

<h2>My Secondary School</h2>

<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">This is my Secondary School which is Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Selinsing. This is an unforgettable memories that still alive in my mind. In this school there are many shappy and sad moments but always the happy moments come first into my mind. What makes this school happy for me is because of my friends. They are a good friends for me. Of course, school is boring but thanks to my friends who make it a place that full of happiness and laughs. I really miss my secondary school friends because they are the best friends that I ever had. Eventhough, sometimes I faced problems but my friends always give me support and tell me not to give up.</p>
<p align="justify">The best moments that I still remember is when we go to the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) together with a bus to attend the University Carnival. At the USM we learned the correct ways in order to apply the best University to ourself after the important exam which is Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia or also known as SPM. I am a Science Stream student but to be honest our batch is not so good in our exam results. However, we always support each other in order to improve our exam results. For an example, we study together, we make some simple notes and distribute it to all of our classmates. Normally, the one who do that things are female students but we also do not forget to our male classmates. We also shared what we got to each other and when we have leisure time in class, all of us will study together. To be honest, they are simple memories but they are unforgettable for me. I really hope that we can see each other again one day.</p>

<h2>My University</h2>
<img src="png/uitm.png" border="2" width="50% lenght="50%" hspace="26%">
<br>
<br>
<p align="justify">This is my University where I study after I got my SPM result. This is a place where I learn to be a brave and independent student. It is because, in University we cannot depend too much on others and sometimes we must go somewhere alone. At first time, I feel uneasy to do many things by myself but through day by day I have understand that I am an adult now. Sometimes, we must go to the library alone, buy foods alone or go to the ATM machine alone if our friends are not available. However, we must also take care of ourself too. For an example, we should not go alone at night without friends.</p>
<p align="justify">Here, I got a few friends too. They are nice too me. I have good classmates that always ask me to join them to eat satay or chicken rice at the nice stalls. I miss the chicken rice at Taman Lembah Bujang which is near our University. Me and my friends always go there beacuse the preice is reasonable and the chicken rice is also tasty and delicious. My friend Hafieza loves to eat there. Normally, we went there by Grab. I really miss the moments before Covid-19 comes. Where we still can meet our friends, learn in our class and meet the lecturers. I hope that Covid-19 will end in 2021.</font></p>
