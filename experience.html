<p align="justify">We depart from UiTM at 8 a.m by taking a taxi to go to the Sungai Petani’s Commuter Station. Then we take the commuter from Sungai Petani to Butterworth. After we have arrived Butterworth we take a ferry in order to go to Penang. Once we are in the ferry, there is a kind man who are willing to take us to the KOMTAR building without charge so, we did not have to take a Grab. During in the journey to the KOMTAR, the man told us that his child is at hospital. After we have arrived at KOMTAR we want to give him fees but he told that there is no need. To pay his kindness, we pray that his child will get well soon.</p>

<p align="justify">Although there are not much places that we visit, but for me it is still a good memories because I am able to do what I have never do before such as take the ferry. I never been in a ferry before. It is nice because I am able to see the beautiful sea. I really love to watch the ocean or sea. I love to feel the soft breeze on my face. That is one of the best experience that ever happen in my life. Lastly, when it is 4.30 p.m. we take a ferry and went back to UiTM. All of us a quite tired but all of us feel happy</p>
