<p align="justify">NurHafieza is my best friend in Uitm. I call her Pija. I trust her because she never make me sad. She always make me happy and smile. When I am sad, the first person that I really want to meet is Pija. When I am sad, she will make me happy again. Normally, when we meet we will go to eat and start to share our problems together. We are not classmate but she is my one and only best friend in Uitm. She never betrays me and I hope she would never do that to me. I do not have many friends in UiTM but luckily I found her. Sometimes, we also go take a fresh air at night and walk around in our residential college. I really miss her during this quarantine. We have plan to meet somewhere when the Covid has stop. I really love Pija because she has a good and kind heart. Although, sometimes she act like a mother but that shows me that she really cared about me. How I miss the nights when we eat instant noodles and sleep together. I miss my friend. She is one and only. Nothing can replace her. I hope our friendship will lasts forever.</p>
